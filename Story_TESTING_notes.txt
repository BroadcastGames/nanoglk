1. nanogit & nanoglulx with story Six.gblorb -- exit with no message. Very brief window flash.
2. nanogit & nanoglulx with story Molly and the Butter Thieves -- does not show left window "Useful commands", might be color text issue (black on black).
2a. FlexWinsCommonCmdsSidebarA.gblorb
3. rover.gblorb has problems with text colors, white on white? from the observer dialog.
4. Wisher_Theurgist_Fatalist.gblorb seems to to recognize all input commands. "west" is rejected, even "quit".
